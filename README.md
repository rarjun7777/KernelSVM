# STEPS IN KERNEL SVM

-> Importing the libraries

-> Importing the dataset

-> Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set

-> Feature Scaling

-> Training the Kernel SVM model on the Training set

-> Predicting a new result

-> Predicting the Test set results

-> Making the Confusion Matrix

-> Visualising the Training set results

-> Visualising the Test set results
